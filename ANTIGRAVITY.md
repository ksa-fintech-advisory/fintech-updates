I am building a personal FinTech updates website targeted primarily toward the Saudi market. I need your help generating the website structure, content, UI/UX recommendations, and code following the points below.

Project Overview

The website focuses on FinTech industry updates, insights, and articles.

The visual identity must follow a Saudi/Arabic-inspired design style, including layout direction, typography recommendations, and color choices aligned with modern Saudi digital aesthetics.

The website must feel fast, clean, and highly professional.

Technical Requirements

The project uses Next.js with server-side rendering.

Localization (i18n) is already implemented.

The folder structure separates admin and website, but for now we are focusing exclusively on the website section.

Follow my current folder-structure philosophy:

Anything related to the public-facing website should be placed under a dedicated website section.

I already added examples for the “services” section. For now, I want all services to be mock services, but structured in a way that I can easily replace them later with real backend integrations.

Goal
